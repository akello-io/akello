# Why the Collaborative Care Model (CoCM) Isn't "Collaborative Care"

The Collaborative Care Model (CoCM) is one popular approach used by primary care providers (PCPs) that involves working together with behavioral health professionals and psychiatrists to provide care and monitor a patient's progress. This popular [model](https://www.psychiatry.org/psychiatrists/practice/professional-interests/integrated-care/learn) focuses on utilizing evidence-based practice guidelines to help patients achieve their clinical goals.

Within the behavioral health field, many people mistake the Collaborative Care Model as any effort involving healthcare staff working together collaboratively. However, the CoCM differs significantly from general collaborative care. In this article, we'll explore the difference between programs and models and why it's important to differentiate the two.

## The Difference Between Program and Model

The term "model" is often used in the healthcare space. A model used in practice is one that includes clear and discrete boundaries that can be replicated. It may outline the best practices or services for a specific population or group. What makes a model unique is that it can be defined across multiple settings. This means it must follow evidence-based practices that can be confirmed. Models are outlined in the literature and follow specific and measurable steps. Furthermore, a model outlines a specific population for which it is intended.

Unlike a model, a "program" is one that does not necessarily follow a documented set of practices in the medical literature. Many healthcare professionals fall into the habit of calling their efforts a "model" when it may be better defined as a "program." While a model can be replicated in another setting, a program is more likely to be a site-specific effort to improve patient care.

If your primary care integration attempt is a collaborative effort between a PCP and behavioral health professionals, it still holds great importance. However, it should be defined as a program rather than a model if it cannot be replicated.

## CoCM Is Not a Collaborative "Program"

The Collaborative Care Model is an effective model for behavioral health and has been validated by more than [90 randomized controlled trials](https://aims.uw.edu/collaborative-care/evidence-base-cocm) cited in the medical literature. As such, the CoCM contains very clear guidelines for implementation. Across various studies, the CoCM has been shown to be more effective than traditional care for patients suffering from behavioral health concerns or mental health diagnoses, such as depression or anxiety.

The CoCM features five core principles that allow it to be replicated in any healthcare facility. To begin with, the focus on patient-centered team care involves a collaborative effort between primary care and behavioral health providers. It is also population-based care, which means it must include tracking patients in a behavioral health tracking system to ensure optimal success. Each patient's treatment plan is evaluated using evidence-based tools, such as the [PHQ-9 depression scale.](https://aims.uw.edu/resource-library/phq-9-depression-scale)

The last two core principles of the Collaborative Care Model include evidence-based care and accountable care. This means the program must offer patients treatments that have been proven successful in medical literature and that healthcare providers are accountable for the quality of the care they provide.

## Benefits of a Clinical Model vs. Clinical Program

Both clinical models and clinical programs seek to improve patient care in ways that differ from the standard of care. They both provide targeted patients with the tools, resources, and support needed to achieve clinical goals.

Utilizing a clinical model for primary care integration helps advance patient care and support patients in a proven manner. Using evidence-based models also helps healthcare facilities stay on track, as a clear and defined set of rules is already in place to follow. When replicated properly, a clinical model may be more likely to achieve the intended results. Lastly, using an evidence-based clinical model can also help generate new knowledge and uncover new findings that can help other healthcare facilities.

While a clinical model has all these benefits, it does not mean that a clinical program cannot be equally as effective. Starting a clinical program offers its own benefits, such as the ability to create guidelines that work for your needs with more flexibility.

## Why It's Important To Understand the Difference

Another way to describe the work implemented by your facility is through levels of integrated care. Levels of integrated care in behavioral health are based on continuums that describe the level of care provided by either a program or a model. Understanding the difference between a collaborative model and collaborative care is important for various healthcare providers, including primary care providers, clinic owners, care managers, and other professionals.

By understanding the correct vocabulary associated with various integrated care models, healthcare professionals can effectively and accurately describe their work. Furthermore, it can help to clarify the confusion that often comes from professionals or students when the same language is used to describe very different things.
