Since day one Akello has been a mission driven organization. But what does this mean in practice?

Mission statements are ubiquitous, especially in healthcare. However, it can be challenging to decipher what values truly guide companies in the space. Despite all of the lofty rhetoric, the healthcare technology sector is still very much an opaque industry, awash in complex jargon, buzzwords and obscure acronyms which serve more to obfuscate rather than educate. At Akello, we wanted to take a different approach by articulating our mission statement and fundamental values clearly and concisely. With that in mind: **Akello's mission is to increase the adoption of measurement-based care models and facilitate the transition to collaborative and integrated care models across the United States.**

We strongly believe that the increased adoption of measurement based care models will lead to better outcomes for patients while also reducing costs for payers and healthcare systems. We view this mission as an essential component in the development of more efficient, equitable and engaging mental health care services in the United States.

We strive to accomplish this mission in the following ways:

**Building a Best in Class Collaborative Platform:** At Akello, we provide a collaborative platform that empowers healthcare providers, organizations, and communities to work together seamlessly. By facilitating communication, data sharing, and coordinated care, our platform fosters collaboration among stakeholders, leading to improved patient outcomes and experiences.

**Committing to Open Source Transparency:** We believe in the power of open source technology to democratize access to healthcare solutions. Through our open source approach, we enable developers and organizations of all sizes to build custom experiences tailored to their unique needs and challenges. By making our tools and resources freely available, we hope to foster innovation and drive widespread adoption of measurement-based care models. Our approach is flexible rather than prescriptive: we believe healthcare teams should work and collaborate in the way that best suits them, as opposed to having to conform to arbitrary, predetermined constraints.

**Developing innovative Enterprise Services:** In addition to our open source offerings, Akello provides enterprise services designed to support organizations in implementing and optimizing measurement-based care practices at scale. Our team offers personalized guidance, training, and support to help healthcare providers navigate the complexities of transitioning to collaborative and integrated care models. Whether it's technical assistance, strategic planning, or ongoing maintenance, we're here to ensure our clients succeed in their mission to improve healthcare delivery.

Through our collaborative platform, open source initiatives, and comprehensive enterprise services, Akello is dedicated to advancing the adoption of measurement-based care models and driving positive change in healthcare delivery across the United States. Together, we're building a future where every individual has access to high-quality, integrated healthcare that meets their unique needs and promotes holistic well-being.

Akello’s community of stakeholders inspires us to strive to uphold our mission and values everyday, and we couldn’t be more excited about the future. Together, we can reshape the future of healthcare for the better!
