# Measurements

Akello supports several validated measurements used by clinicians to assess the severity of the initial symptoms patients present and to evaluate the progress of the treatment plan as time progresses. Akello's Registry tool offers a wide range of customizable filters and flagging options which allow clinical teams to track the effectiveness of their treatment plans across an entire patient population and ensure that higher-risk patients receive the attention they need, thereby facilitating better quality care.
