# Adult ADHD Self-Report Scale (ASRS)


The Adult ADHD Self-Report Scale (ASRS v1.1) is a questionnaire consisting of 18 items for self-reporting, developed to identify symptoms of Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) in individuals aged 18 and older. It derives from the World Health Organization's Composite International Diagnostic Interview (2001), with its questions aligned with the DSM criteria, yet modified to more accurately represent how symptoms appear in adults. This tool is effective for both screening and diagnosing ADHD in adults and is recommended to be used alongside a clinical interview to gather further clinical insights.
