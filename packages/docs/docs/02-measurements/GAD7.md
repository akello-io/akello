# Generalized Anxiety Disorder 7-item (GAD-7)


The GAD-7 (General Anxiety Disorder-7) screener is a self-administered questionnaire used to assess the severity of generalized anxiety disorder (GAD) symptoms in individuals. Consisting of seven items, it asks respondents to rate how often they have been bothered by specific anxiety-related symptoms over the past two weeks. The symptoms addressed include feeling nervous, anxious, or on edge; not being able to stop or control worrying; worrying too much about different things; trouble relaxing; being so restless that it's hard to sit still; becoming easily annoyed or irritable; and feeling afraid as if something awful might happen.

Each item on the GAD-7 is scored from 0 (not at all) to 3 (nearly every day), yielding a total score that ranges from 0 to 21. Scores are interpreted as follows: 0-4 (minimal anxiety), 5-9 (mild anxiety), 10-14 (moderate anxiety), and 15-21 (severe anxiety). This tool is widely used in both clinical and research settings due to its simplicity, reliability, and validity. It serves as a quick screening tool to help identify individuals who may need further evaluation for GAD and can also be used to monitor changes in symptoms over time.
