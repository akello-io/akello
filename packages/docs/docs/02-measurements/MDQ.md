# Mood Disorder Questionnaire (MDQ)


The Mood Disorder Questionnaire (MDQ) is a self-report questionnaire designed to help screen for the presence of bipolar disorder. It consists of a series of 13 questions related to life experiences that are common among people who have had episodes of mania or hypomania. These questions cover aspects such as mood swings, energy levels, self-confidence, and behaviors related to spending, sexual activity, and talkativeness. 

Respondents are asked to answer "yes" or "no" to whether they have experienced these symptoms. Additionally, the MDQ asks about the co-occurrence of symptoms and the degree of functional impairment caused by them, if any. The questionnaire is intended to be a preliminary screening tool, not a diagnostic instrument. A positive screening result suggests that a person may benefit from a comprehensive psychiatric evaluation for bipolar disorder. The MDQ has been widely used in clinical settings and research, and it is recognized for its simplicity and effectiveness in identifying symptoms that are indicative of bipolar disorder.
