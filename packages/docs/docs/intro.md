# Akello's Open-Source Approach in Healthcare

In healthcare, the use of exclusive software often means that how clinical data is handled remains a secret. This can prevent healthcare systems from working together smoothly and slow down improvements in patient care. It also makes it harder to deliver care that focuses on the patient's needs, leading to a more disjointed healthcare system.

Akello offers something different from what's usually found in the market. We're the first open-source platform that focuses on the health of entire populations.

### Akello is about doing things openly and differently
In short, Akello is about doing things openly and differently, with the aim of improving healthcare for everyone.

We believe in open-source for five main reasons:

### 1. Quality
Our development is open for anyone to see and contribute to, unlike other systems that only a few engineers work on in private. This means more people can help improve our software, making it more reliable.

### 2. Agility
Akello is built with flexible, interchangeable parts. This makes it easy to customize and develop various solutions quickly, leading to better and more personal patient care.

### 3. Transparency
We make it clear how we use and protect patient data. This builds trust and ensures accountability.

### 4. Security
We check our platform every day for security risks and have regular checks by security experts. This keeps patient data safe.

### 5. Innovation
Our platform is designed to encourage new ideas in healthcare technology. By providing the basic tools everyone needs, we hope to inspire new advances that go beyond what Akello does.


## Why Choose Akello?

Akello is unique because it offers unmatched flexibility. You're not stuck with just one supplier, giving you the freedom to mix and match different options to create care experiences that meet your exact needs. Plus, if you'd rather not spend time on technical details, Akello provides a full management solution.
