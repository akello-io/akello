# Akello's Open-Source Approach in Healthcare

In healthcare, the use of exclusive software often means that the way clinical data is handled remains a secret. This can prevent healthcare systems from working together smoothly and slow down improvements in patient care. It also makes it harder to deliver care that focuses on the patient's needs, leading to poorer patient outcomes and a more dysfunctional healthcare system.

Akello offers something different from the closed-sourced solutions most commonly found in the market. We're the first open-source platform that focuses on integrated care models.

In short, Akello is about doing things openly and differently, with the goal of improving healthcare for everyone.

We believe in the open-source movement for five main reasons:

### 1. Quality
Our development is open for anyone to see and contribute to, unlike other systems that only a few engineers work on in private. This means more people can help improve our software, making it more reliable.

### 2. Agility
Akello is built with flexibility and modularity in mind. This makes it easy to develop a wide range of customized solutions quickly, leading to better and more personalized patient care.

### 3. Transparency
We make it clear upfront how we use and protect patient data. This builds trust and ensures we are accountable to all of our stakeholders.

### 4. Security
We review our platform daily for security risks and have regular audits by security experts. This ensures we keep patient data safe.

### 5. Innovation
Our platform is designed to encourage new ideas in healthcare technology. By providing the basic tools everyone needs, we hope to inspire new advances that go beyond the solutions Akello currently offers.


## Why Choose Akello?

Akello is unique because it offers unparalleled flexibility. You're not locked into a vendor, but instead have the freedom to mix and match different options to create care experiences that meet your exact needs.
