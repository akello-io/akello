# Team based care

In mental health, the difference in the quality of outcomes between integrated care and the traditional, siloed care patients typically receive is pronounced: integrated models consistently lead to higher quality outcomes. Despite this, siloed models persist due to the complexity involved in facilitating consistent and actionable collaboration and communication between various members of the care team. Akello offers an innovation solution to this quandary, an easy to use, cohesive platform that can facilitate seamless collaboration, supported by integrations with cutting-edge communications tools like Slack to ensure your team is operating at its very best.
