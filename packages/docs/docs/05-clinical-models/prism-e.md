# Primary Care Research in Substance Abuse and Mental Health for the Elderly study (PRISM-E)

The Primary Care Research in Substance Abuse and Mental Health for the Elderly (PRISM-E) study investigated models of care for older adults with psychiatric disturbances. It compared an integrated model—where mental health and substance abuse (MH/SA) services were co-located within primary care practices, allowing primary care clinicians to play an active role in MH/SA treatment—with an enhanced referral model that involved referring patients to separate MH/SA specialty clinics. This latter model was supplemented with transportation, case management, and other services to encourage elderly patients to engage in treatment. The study found that clinicians strongly preferred the integrated care model over the enhanced referral model for several reasons, including better comprehensiveness of services, management of depression, convenience for patients, and quicker appointments for mental health services【1】【2】.

As for billing within the context of the PRISM-E study, the available information primarily focuses on the comparison of treatment models, service utilization, and clinical outcomes rather than the specifics of billing practices. Integrated care models often involve billing for mental health services within the primary care setting, potentially offering a more streamlined approach for billing and reimbursement compared to separate billing for services provided in specialty MH/SA clinics. However, the specifics of billing would depend on the healthcare system, the insurance coverage of the patient, and the particular arrangements of the clinics involved in the PRISM-E study. The focus of the PRISM-E study was more on the effectiveness and preferences of care models rather than the financial and billing aspects【3】【4】.

For detailed information about the study and its findings, I would recommend looking into resources from the Annals of Family Medicine and BMC Public Health, which provide comprehensive insights into the PRISM-E study and similar research on integrating MH/SA services in primary care【5】【6】. For billing specifics in such care models, consulting with healthcare providers or experts in healthcare billing within the context of integrated MH/SA services might offer more direct insights.
