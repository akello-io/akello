# Clinical Models

Akello can be used to implement a wide range of clinical models, from CoCM to PCBH and PRISM-E. While these models might vary in their organizational complexity and requisite logistical processes, they have been scientifically proven to lead to higher-quality outcomes for patients while also reducing costs for healthcare systems and payers alike. No matter what model your organization is utilizing, Akello's solutions can enhance collaboration, streamline billing, and provide comprehensive patient monitoring at scale. At Akello, our mission has been the same since day one: help clinical teams provide measurement-based care more efficiently so that they can focus on what matters most: providing superior care to their patients.
