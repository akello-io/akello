# 2. Refer Patient

Referring a new patient efficiently involves using the patient registry you set up previously. This step is crucial to maintaining an organized and effective patient management system.

### 1. Initiating the Patient Referral
- **Where to Start**: Look towards the top right corner of your screen where you'll find the 'Add Patient' option. This is your gateway to begin the referral process for a new patient.
- **Action Step**: Click on 'Add Patient' to start the process. This is the first step in introducing a new patient into your care system.

### 2. Completing Patient Details
- **Filling the Form**: Once you click 'Add Patient', a form will appear. It's important to fill in all the necessary details about the patient in this form. 
- **Details to Include**: Ensure that you include comprehensive information such as the patient's name, date of birth, contact information, medical history, and any relevant notes that would aid in their care.
- **Accuracy is Key**: Double-check the information for accuracy. This is vital for creating a reliable and useful patient profile.

### 3. Finalizing the Referral
- **Saving the Information**: After you have filled out all the information, the final step is to click 'Save'.
- **Completing the Process**: This will officially add the patient to your registry, completing the referral process. The patient's information is now securely stored in your system and ready for future reference and appointments.

This systematic approach ensures that every new patient is efficiently integrated into your system, allowing for better tracking and management of their care.
