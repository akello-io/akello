# 3. Start Treatment Session

Beginning a treatment session at the start of a patient's appointment is key to ensuring that all minutes and measurements are accurately recorded. This process not only aids in effective patient management but also ensures that every aspect of the patient's care is meticulously documented.

### Steps to Initiate and Manage a Treatment Session

#### 1. Accessing the Patient's Profile
- **Finding the Right Patient**: Navigate to the patient's profile who is scheduled for the session. This can be done by selecting their profile from your list of patients.
- **Preparation for the Session**: Accessing the profile is the first step in preparing for the treatment session. It gives you a quick overview of the patient's history and any notes you might need before starting.

#### 2. Starting the Treatment Session
- **Activating Session Tracking**: To begin the actual treatment session, click on 'Start Session'. This action initiates the tracking of the session's duration and other important metrics.
- **Importance of Timely Start**: Starting the session as soon as the appointment begins is crucial for accurate time and activity recording.

#### 3. Recording Screening Responses
- **Inputting Session Details**: During the session, you'll need to enter relevant information in the fields provided. This could include responses to screening questions, notes on patient responses, or other observations made during the session.
- **Comprehensive Documentation**: Ensuring that all pertinent information is recorded during the session is vital for comprehensive patient care and future reference.

#### 4. Ending and Saving the Session
- **Concluding the Session**: Once the treatment session is complete, it's important to formally end it by clicking 'Save'. 
- **Halting the Timer and Saving Data**: This action stops the session timer and saves all the data you've entered. It's a critical step in finalizing the session's record in the patient's file.

By following these steps, you create a detailed and accurate record of each treatment session, which is essential for ongoing patient care and future treatment planning. This process not only aids in patient management but also contributes to the overall quality of care provided.
