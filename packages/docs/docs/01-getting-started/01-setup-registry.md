# 1. Setup a Registry

Creating a registry in your system is a straightforward process, designed to be user-friendly and efficient. Here's a step-by-step guide to setting up a registry, starting right after you log in.

### Initial Step: Creating the Registry
**Starting Point**: After logging in, head to the top right corner of your screen and click on `CREATE REGISTRY`.

#### 1. Naming Your Registry
- **Importance of a Descriptive Name**: Choose a name that accurately describes your patient population. This is particularly helpful if you're managing multiple population models or coordinating with team members across different registries.
- **Strategy for Naming**: Consider using names that reflect the specific group or condition you're managing, as this makes it easier to identify and access the registry.

#### 2. Selecting Screeners
- **Choosing Screeners**: From the provided dropdown menu, select one or more screeners that are relevant to assessing your population.
- **Custom Screeners Option**: If you have specific needs, you can opt to use custom screeners. Instructions for this can be found [here](/).

#### 3. Adding Team Members

**Sensitive Information Warning**: Remember, patient information is sensitive. Ensure that anyone you add to the registry is authorized to view this information.

- **Setting Roles for Team Members**: When adding your team members, assign them roles. These roles are crucial for aspects like time tracking for billing purposes. In the future, roles can also help in customizing views and notifications to make them more relevant to each team member.
- **Invitations and Access**: Upon creating the registry, new users will receive an invite to join if they aren't already part of Akello. Existing users will see the new registry in their dashboard.

By following these steps, you can efficiently set up a registry that is tailored to your specific needs and is easy for your team to use and manage.
