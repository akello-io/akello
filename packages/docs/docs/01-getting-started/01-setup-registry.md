# 1. Setup a Registry


Setting up a registry is super simple. All you need to do after you login is select the `CREATE REGISTRY` on the top right corner.

Once you are in the create workflow experience you will be guided through the following steps



#### 1. Set the name of your Registry.

Use a name that is descriptive of your population. This will be helpful if you are running multiple population models with team members across registries.

#### 2. Define which screeners you want for this population.

From the `dropdown` select 1 or more screeners you want to measure the population by. If you would like to use your own custom screener follow the instructions over [here](/).


#### 3. Invite your team members

:::danger Sensitive Patient Information 

Make sure the users added to the registry are authorized to view patient information. 

:::

Add your team member and set their role. The role helps with tracking time when it comes to billing and in the future we can customize views and notifications so that they are more relevant.

Once you create the registry the users will get an invite if they are not part of Akello. If they are they will be able to see the registry from their dashboard.
