# 5. Coordinate with Team

Effective coordination among healthcare providers, especially in Collaborative Care Models (CoCM), is crucial for delivering high-quality patient care. Utilizing 'Flags' is a key method for facilitating this coordination. Flags serve as important markers or alerts that can be used in various ways to enhance communication and collaboration among team members.

### 1. Flags - A Tool for Collaboration

#### a. Flagging a Psychiatrist
In situations where a patient's condition requires psychiatric evaluation or intervention, you can flag a psychiatrist. This flag acts as a direct alert to the psychiatrist in your team, indicating that a particular patient needs their attention. It's a way to ensure that patients with specific mental health needs are promptly and effectively attended to.

#### b. Flag for Review
Sometimes, a patient's case might need a more in-depth review or a second opinion. By using the 'Flag for Review', you can highlight these cases to your colleagues. This could be for complex cases, cases where there is uncertainty in diagnosis or treatment plans, or when there's a significant change in a patient's condition. This flag ensures that such cases are brought to the team's attention during meetings or consultations, promoting collaborative decision-making.

#### c. Flagging a Safety Risk
Patient safety is paramount. If there's a concern about a patient's safety - be it due to their health condition, medication, or any other factor - a 'Safety Risk' flag can be used. This alerts all team members to the potential risk, ensuring that everyone is aware and can take appropriate precautions or interventions. It's particularly important in managing patients who might be at risk of harming themselves or others, or when a patient's condition might deteriorate rapidly.
