# The Value of Measurement-Based Care in CoCM

![image](image.jpg)

For physician groups, psychiatrists, primary care providers, clinic owners, and those who manage them, ensuring quality clinical supervision is one of your great responsibilities. Proper supervision is the No. 1 way to guarantee clients are receiving quality care and that clinicians are progressing in their practice. It&#39;s also essential for mitigating risk for your organization.

But many wonder how they can verify their supervision with real-world data. More organizations are turning to measurement-based care (MBC) as the answer. MBC is rapidly changing how clinics run the collaborative care model (CoCM).

Whether the concept of MBC is new to you or you&#39;ve heard of it but are unsure how it works, this article is for you. You will learn all about MBC and the value it brings to clinicians, care managers, and clinic admins. You&#39;ll also read about an exciting pilot program that can put your organization at the forefront of MBC.

## What Is Measurement-Based Care?

At a high level, MBC can be defined as the practice of basing clinical care on client data collected throughout treatment. It is a central component of many evidence-based treatment practices. MBC first gained popularity in clinical settings as a way to gain insight into a client&#39;s treatment and measure treatment targets. As such, MBC fits nicely into behavioral health treatment but is now seen as an evidence-based framework for any treatment.

Over time, industry experts noted that the data collected in MBC is not only a great tool to ensure successful treatment but also proved to be fundamental in supervision models. Care managers and clinic admins have embraced MBC as a way to measure a clinician&#39;s progress and growth in their careers. It also provides empirical data that helps mitigate risk for clinical teams by providing early alerts to any problems that may arise during treatment.

## What Are the Benefits of Measurement-Based Care?

The benefits of MBC are many, but here is a breakdown of some of the most important:

### Empirical Data

MBC models bring a standardized rating scale to the client treatment process. This scale transforms the many subjective experiences that occur in treatment into empirical data that care managers can act on. Even though all indicators can be quantified, establishing a baseline level of treatment and having a standard frame of reference helps care providers and managers assess client progress and provider effectiveness.

### Effective and Personalized Treatment

The data gathered and analyzed in MBC provides greater insight into a client&#39;s treatment. Providers can then offer more effective and personalized treatment and share their insights across collaborative care teams. Insights gained through MBC can help determine proper medication dosages and treatment plans and even match clients with the right provider.

### More Involved Clients

When MBC is properly implemented, care providers regularly solicit patient feedback. The increase in client information — and the general quality of this data — allows clinicians to deliver more effective preventative care. MBC also helps direct patients toward the resources and tools that enable better self-care and overall improved treatment outcomes.

## What Are the Challenges of Measurement-Based Care?

Of course, any system that provides such great benefits will present some challenges in implementation, and MBC is no exception. These issues mostly come down to a lack of understanding of how MBC works and not having the right systems in place to collect analytics data. Here&#39;s an overview of some more notable challenges of MBC:

### Infrequent Questionnaires

At the heart of any MBC implementation is client questionnaires. If these questionnaires aren&#39;t given to patients regularly, there will be a lack of data, and MBC will be much less effective. This issue applies particularly to primary care providers who may only see a patient once a year.

### Data Is Not Easily Accessible

Many providers only collect assessment data on paper, which may or may not be input into an electronic health records (EHR) system. Manual data collection makes it more difficult to collect data in a central location, limiting the potential for analysis.

### Technology Managers Aren&#39;t Involved

In many cases, when an organization decides to implement an MBC system, technology managers aren&#39;t included in the process. This oversight may result in the selected system being unable to sync automatically to the group&#39;s EHR system. The technology manager may also not be trained to integrate MBC data into their systems. This lack of technology strategy severely limits the utility of MBC data. It&#39;s important to remember technology managers&#39; roles in providing data to your organization and to enlist them in your MBC efforts.

## How to Best Use MBC Data

MBC can offer a large amount of data if collected in a centralized system and run through the right analysis tools. But what is the best way to use all this information?

MBC experts recommend that the data be seen as the same as all the other data a clinic collects. Some care providers may be concerned that their performance will be graded on MBC data, even though that&#39;s not the end goal. Instead of looking at it as the central component of supervision, insights gained from MBC should be seen as an opportunity for learning and training.

When supervising care providers, MBC data shouldn&#39;t be used to measure how well a provider is doing their job. It certainly can be a starting point for conversations about patient care, but it&#39;s not a report card.

The ultimate goals of clinics using MBC should be to:

- Run as efficiently as possible
- Aid communication between different care providers, such as physicians and psychiatrists
- Ensure regulatory compliance and proper billing
- Improve client treatment

So, while MBC data shouldn&#39;t be used for grading care providers, it can note and celebrate progress. In clinical scenarios where all the goals listed above have been met, it would be appropriate to let staff know that MBC data is evidence of how well they are doing.
