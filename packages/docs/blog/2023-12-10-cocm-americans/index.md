# CoCM: How It Gets More Americans to Evidence-Based Mental Health Care

Americans struggle with mental health, and it&#39;s become a growing problem since the pandemic. People of all ages find it difficult to manage mental health issues thanks to the difficulty in receiving adequate care. Collaborative Care (CoCM) aims to change that by offering integrated care options, where common mental health problems may be treated in primary care and similar clinics.

## What is CoCM?

The concept of [Collaborative Care](https://aims.uw.edu/collaborative-care) was originally developed at the University of Washington. It focuses on some of the more common mental health issues people face, particularly those requiring ongoing checks. These conditions include depression, anxiety, and other chronic mental problems.

Patients diagnosed with these diseases may find it challenging to get the necessary care. To make it easier to treat them, CoCM is designed to create more accessible health care for the mind as well as body. Essentially, the patient&#39;s team is led by the primary care provider and is comprised of mental health professionals, including psychiatrists and behavioral health care managers. The team works together to determine the best course of treatment using evidence-based practice guidelines.

Patients are added to a registry and tracked to ensure progress is made. If the patient is not improving, their primary practice can contact the team, check with them, and provide a team-created solution. It&#39;s a method of ensuring no one is missed.

With CoCM, quality of care is promoted, with providers being paid for the clinical outcome and the type of care provided. This is a vast improvement over the usual model, which promotes quantity over quality. It also helps eliminate some of the more common problems that occur when faced with mental health problems.

For example, generally, patients are not diagnosed until adulthood, despite 50% of mental health disorders presenting by age 14 and [75% by age 25](https://mmhpi.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/Behavioral-Health-Care-for-Youth-CoCM-Expansion-Nov2022.pdf). Since pediatric care divides primary care and mental health care and keeps them separate, it&#39;s difficult for teens to get diagnosed and treated. With CoCM, mental health care is integrated into the pediatric setting. Patients are screened early, and anyone who has symptoms can be treated and tracked.

Early diagnosis can be life-changing. Making mental health care available to everyone all the time can result in fewer problems going untreated and ensures children and teens receive a proper diagnosis.

## Top Benefits of CoCM

The benefits of Collaborative Care aren&#39;t just for patients. Healthcare providers also find it rewarding to work within the model.

### **Create More Patient-Centered Care**

When everyone is working together to figure out what is going on with a patient, it can result in better care for the patient. The care they receive is far more comprehensive when multiple team members work together to find the best treatments. In addition, this reduces the workload on one individual healthcare professional and can help create more effective care.

### **Reduce Readmissions**

Patients with a misdiagnosis often end up returning for further treatment. They need to be correctly diagnosed, then treated. This is far more likely when health providers can communicate easily and share necessary information about the patient&#39;s needs. Once a patient is diagnosed correctly, the correct treatment can be prescribed, determined by collaboration between team members. In the end, a properly diagnosed and the treated patient is less likely to need readmission.

### **Improve Overall Treatment**

When multiple healthcare workers are treating the same patient independently, it may be challenging to ensure the patient&#39;s treatment information is shared. CoCM helps prevent communication gaps and makes it easier for providers to collaborate on how to improve the care for a patient.

Of course, the patient will also receive improved care when CoCM is implemented. Here are a few of the patient-specific benefits:

### **Provide More Effective Care**

The old adage, "two heads are better than one" is very true in this healthcare model. Patients benefit from several medical and mental health professionals discussing their case. Everyone has their own skills and experience that may be brought to the table, but evidence-based treatments are the go-to for CoCM. Patient care is [far more effective](https://www.psychiatry.org/psychiatrists/practice/professional-interests/integrated-care/learn) when using a team to treat those with mental health issues.

### **Identify Mental Health Problems Early**

Left untreated, many mental health issues can worsen. It&#39;s easier to treat someone at the beginning of their disease, and Collaborative Care helps improve the outcome. Often, patients visit their general physician to inquire about depression, anxiety, and other mental health problems. Since the GP is not usually qualified to manage this type of care, it can be detrimental to the patient&#39;s mental health. On average, people are diagnosed between eight and ten years after the initial symptoms appear. Collaborative Care provides access to a mental health professional early on, which can drastically improve diagnosis rates and ensure early treatment.

### **Lower the Costs of Medical Care**

Mental health problems can be costly. One study indicated that using IMPACT (Improving Mood and Promoting Access to Collaborative Treatment) saved [an average of $3,365](https://aims.uw.edu/collaborative-care/building-business-case-cost-effectiveness-studies-collaborative-care) per patient over a four-year period. This was despite the patients receiving intervention for only the first year. Other studies also showed improved medical costs over time when Collaborative Care was implemented.

## Collaborative Care Roles

There are generally three primary team members, though the team may have more if necessary. Let&#39;s take a closer look at their roles:

### **Medical Provider**

The medical provider is usually the main person interacting with the patient and is responsible for discussing the system with the patient. Once the patient has given permission for their enrollment, the behavioral health care manager will work with the patient.

### **Behavioral Health Care Manager**

They provide short interventions and will track the patient&#39;s progress. They also communicate with the PCP, who monitors everything and manages the patient&#39;s overall care. The BHCM is responsible for collaborating with the psychiatric consultant to determine the best choice in treatment, as well as ensuring the patient is steadily improving.

### **Psychiatric Consultant**

The consultant plays a big part in developing the right treatment plan for the patient. They work with the BHCM to develop the best treatment for the patient and may also talk with the PCP as needed.

Each team member is important. With multiple people caring for and tracking a patient, it&#39;s much easier to see if they are improving or if they need an adjustment to their treatment.

## How Primary Health Care Providers Can Implement CoCM

[Collaborative Care](https://aims.uw.edu/collaborative-care/implementation-guide/lay-foundation) is basically a whole new way of practicing medicine. To fully implement it into your practice, you must be open to change.

Before anything else, you should fully understand what Collaborative Care is and how it works. Your entire team needs to be on the same page, so everyone must do their homework.

From there, you&#39;ll need to talk to the clinical team and organizational leadership to ensure everyone understands the importance of CoCM. The team can work together to build a plan that will improve the quality of patient care.

There will be significant changes in how your clinic works when implementing Collaborative Care. You will need to determine each team member&#39;s role and design a workflow.

- Who will see the patient first?
- When will others be brought in?
- How will this work in your clinic?

You&#39;ll also need to determine how you&#39;ll track both treatment and progress for the patient. Remember that team members will likely work outside their usual trained roles, which can be challenging. It&#39;s best if the entire team can work together to improve their knowledge and become accustomed to relying on one another.

An action plan is an essential part of building the care team. Still, you&#39;ll also need to consider funding, human resources, clinical space, and other administrative considerations. There are many things to plan for, and having the plan in place before you begin will help the entire team function better.

Team training is another part of implementing CoCM. It&#39;s possible to take [online courses](https://www.psychiatry.org/psychiatrists/practice/professional-interests/integrated-care/get-trained) for this. Training helps provide each team member with the information they need to better fit their roles on the team.

The next step is talking to your patients. You&#39;ll need their permission to enroll them in the CoCM plan. Education is critical here. The more the patient understands how multiple professionals can help them, the more likely they will take that step. You will work with the patient to develop a plan from the start of their treatment to the end. This should also include what to do if there is a relapse and prevent relapses where possible.

Once you begin working with CoCM in your clinic, you will want to track how it works. Clinical outcomes are important, so keep detailed records.

After the initial launch, it&#39;s necessary to continue reviewing your practices. What is working? Where could you improve? These are all things to consider as you move forward with your plan.

## Why Isn&#39;t CoCM More Commonly Used?

The big question you may be asking is why it isn&#39;t CoCM more commonly implemented if it works so well? While more digital options are arising to make it easier to implement CoCM, Collaborative Care faces several significant challenges.

- **Poorly Designed Payer Models:**  Unfortunately, many payer models do not support this type of care. Medicaid is gradually moving toward CoCM, but those in decision-making positions must be convinced to move things forward.
- **Lack of Resources:**  Unfortunately, mental health systems throughout the U.S. are not ideal. They tend to miss early onset mental illness.
- **Lack of Technical Expertise:**  Many clinicians, as well as patients, just aren&#39;t comfortable with using mental health digital programs. While these can be very useful in settings where mental health professionals may not be readily available, such as in rural areas, not everyone knows to use them. If a physician is uncomfortable with the format, they usually avoid referring anyone to the digital options.
- **Irregular Coverage:**  While Medicaid accepts CoCM as a covered benefit, only [22 states](https://mmhpi.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/Behavioral-Health-Care-for-Youth-CoCM-Expansion-Nov2022.pdf) implement this. On top of this, the reimbursement is spotty, and coverage is iffy throughout many states.
- **Difficulty in Making Referrals:**  A patient needing mental health care may not be referred simply because there are no digital mental health systems in the clinic. If a clinician doesn&#39;t have access to a referral system, things become far more complicated. A patient seeking medical aid for a mental health concern may not be sufficiently motivated to visit yet another healthcare professional when referred verbally.
- **Mental Health Professionals Shortage:**  There aren&#39;t enough mental health professionals available to meet the current need for mental health care. This is particularly true in underserved communities, where the struggle to get proper healthcare can be difficult.

These challenges are just a few of the reasons you don&#39;t currently see many options in the world of integrated care models. However, all that can change if you&#39;re willing to help out.

## What You Can Do to Help

Are you interested in helping improve the mental health field and treatment options in the U.S.? It takes a community to make a difference, but it is possible. Congress, the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services, and state Medicaid authorities could change everything and ensure this model is implemented. However, only some organizations are motivated to make the necessary changes.

A simple way to help Collaborative Care expand is to educate those in charge. Talk to your state policymakers and tell them why it is such an essential method of helping those with mental health struggles. It&#39;s something that affects everyone, whether they suffer from a mental health issue or not, as those around them have an impact.

How can you do this? Contact your local policymaker and let them know what you think. If enough people push for the change, more leaders will take note, which can change how each state handles things.

Everyone deserves better health and mental care, but it will only happen if everyone does their part. Join us in making sure every state offers CoCM through Medicare.
