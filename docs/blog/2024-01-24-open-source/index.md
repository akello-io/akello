# Akello Goes Open Source: A New Chapter in Healthcare Tech

In an industry where advancements can significantly impact lives, we are proud to announce a pivotal shift in our journey. Akello, our healthcare technology platform, is now open source.

### Embracing Transparency and Collaboration

Our decision to transition Akello into the open-source realm is more than just a strategic move; it's a commitment to transparency and collective betterment. The healthcare tech world is complex and ever-evolving, and we believe that by opening up our platform, we're not just sharing codeâ€”we're inviting collaboration.

### The Power of Community

Going open source means inviting the community to engage directly with Akello's development. This isn't just about more eyes on our code; it's about integrating diverse perspectives that drive innovation. By welcoming developers, tech enthusiasts, and professionals from across the globe, we're setting the stage for more robust security, advanced features, and ultimately, a platform that's more attuned to the needs of the healthcare industry.

### What This Means for You

For our users and the broader community, this shift promises enhancements in how we serve you. The open-source model fosters an environment of continuous improvement, powered by collective expertise and shared goals. As Akello evolves through community contributions, users can expect a platform that not only meets but anticipates their needs.

### Join Us on This Journey

We're on the cusp of an exciting new chapter. By embracing open source, we're not just changing how we work; we're redefining what it means to be a part of the healthcare technology community.
